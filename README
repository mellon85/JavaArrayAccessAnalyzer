This is just a prototype i have developed for my postgraduation thesis.
It analyzes java bytecode, using the ASM library, looking for possible
places where there can be an ArrayOutOfBoundException without executing
the code.

To use it just build it with gradle:

./gradlew shadowJar

And run it:

java -jar build/libs/StaticAnalyzer-all.jar path-to-class-file
